# Introduction

This module provides a way to install and configure Swift storage clusters using
puppet. The classes documented in this file will deploy Swift using best
practices for a typical deployment.

Both single host and clustered configurations are supported.

[![Unit Test Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-swift.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-swift)

## Tested Environments
  * Ubuntu 12.04; puppet 2.7.16; Swift 1.4.8

# Requirements

This module uses exported resources to manage Swift rings, so you will need 
to have storeconfigs enabled for this module to work. See:

http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/1/wiki/using_stored_configuration
http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/exported_resources.html

Also, since the module includes custom types and providers, 
make sure that pluginsync is enabled in master and agent configurations:

    root@ubuntu:~# cat /etc/puppet/puppet.conf 
    [main]
    logdir=/var/log/puppet
    vardir=/var/lib/puppet
    ssldir=/var/lib/puppet/ssl
    rundir=/var/run/puppet
    factpath=$vardir/lib/facter
    templatedir=$confdir/templates
    prerun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-pre
    postrun_command=/etc/puppet/etckeeper-commit-post
    pluginsync = true

See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/guides/plugins_in_modules.html

# Usage: #

## swift: ##

class that sets up base packages and the base /etc/swift/swift.conf.

    class { 'swift':
      # shared salt used when hashing ring mappings
      swift_hash_suffix => 'shared_secret',
    }

## swift::proxy: ##

class that installs and configures the swift proxy server

    class { 'swift::proxy':
      # specifies that account should be automatically created
      # this should be set to true when tempauth is used
      account_autocreate = true,
      proxy_local_net_ip = $ipaddress_eth1,
      #proxy_port = '11211',
      # auth type defaults to tempauth - this is the
      # only auth that has been tested
      #auth_type = 'tempauth',
    }

## swift::storage ##

class that sets up all of the configuration and dependencies for swift storage
server instances

    class { 'swift::storage':
      # address that swift should bind to
      storage_local_net_ip => $ipaddress_eth1,
      devices              => '/srv/node'
    }

## swift::storage::server ##

Defined resource type that can be used to create a swift storage server
instance. In general, you do not need to explicity specify your server instances
(as the swift::storage::class will create them for you)

This will configure an rsync server instance and swift storage instance to
manage the all devices in the devices directory.

    # the title for this server and the port where it
    # will be hosted
    swift::storage::server { '6010':
      # the type of device (account/object/container)
      type => 'object',
      # directory where device is mounted
      devices => '/srv/node',
      # address to bind to
      storage_local_net_ip => '127.0.0.1'
    }

## swift::storage::loopback ##

This defined resource was created to test swift by creating loopback devices
that can be used for testing

It creates a partition of size [$seek] at base_dir/[$name] using dd with
[$byte_size], formats it to be an xfs filesystem which is mounted at
[$mnt_base_dir]/[$name]

It then creates swift::storage::devices for each device type using the title as
the 3rd digit of a four digit port number :60[digit][role] (object = 0,
container = 1, account = 2)

    swift::storage::loopback { '1':
      base_dir  => '/srv/loopback-device',
      mnt_base_dir => '/srv/node',
      byte_size => '1024',
      seek      => '25000',
      storage_local_net_ip => '127.0.0.1'
}

## swift::ringbuiler ##

class that knows how to build rings.

Creates the initial rings, collects any exported resources, and rebalances the
ring if it is updated.

      class { 'swift::ringbuilder':
        part_power     => '18',
        replicas       => '3',
        min_part_hours => '1',
      }

# Example #

For an example of how to use this module to build out a single node swift
cluster, you can have a look at examples/all.pp

This example can be used as follows:

    puppet apply examples/all.pp      # swift specific roles
                 examples/keystone.pp # keystone config

For an example of how to use this module to build out a multi node swift
cluster, you can have a look at examples/site.pp. This file assumes you have a
puppetmaster with storeconfigs enabled.

NOTE: this example file uses hiera to set the configurable data values. Hiera should
work by default with Puppet 3.0.

Hiera is initiated by the calls to hiera at the beginning of the example file. Feel
free to comment out these lines and use the commented out regular variable assigments
if you do not feel like setting up hiera on Puppet < 3.0.

Please note that if you create fewer than 3 storage nodes, you will need to edit
the `replicas` parameter of the swift::ringbuilder instance in the proxy node
definition.

Once your puppetmaster is configured, you can provision your nodes with:

    puppet agent -t --certname my_role

# Verifying installation #

This module also comes with a simple Ruby script that validates rather or not
your swift cluster is functional.

The script can be run as:

    ruby files/swift_tester.rb
